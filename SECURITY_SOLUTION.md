# Security Vulnerabilities - Best Solution

## Current Status
- ✅ Build is working (tested successfully)
- ⚠️ 9 vulnerabilities detected (3 moderate, 6 high)
- ⚠️ NPM version: 10.9.3 (should be 11.6.0)

## Root Cause Analysis
The vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies of `react-scripts`:
1. `nth-check` < 2.0.1 (High) - Used by `svgo` → `@svgr/plugin-svgo` → `@svgr/webpack` → `react-scripts`
2. `postcss` < 8.4.31 (Moderate) - Used by `resolve-url-loader` → `react-scripts`
3. `webpack-dev-server` <= 5.2.0 (Moderate) - Used by `react-scripts`

## Best Solution: Override Vulnerable Dependencies

Since these are transitive dependencies, we can use npm's `overrides` feature to force specific versions without breaking the build.

### Step 1: Add Overrides to package.json
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "nth-check": ">=2.0.1",
    "postcss": ">=8.4.31",
    "webpack-dev-server": ">=5.2.0"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Verify Security
```bash
npm audit
```

### Step 4: Test Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Alternative Solution: Use .npmrc
Create `.npmrc` file with:
```
audit-level=moderate
fund=false
```

## NPM Version Update
For npm version update, user needs to run:
```bash
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ All vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Build remains functional
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ NPM updated to latest version
